0.01  Wed Aug 12 21:58:13 1998

    - original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Sun Oct 25 20:18:17 1998

    - Added several Win32 API functions (typemap courtesy 
      of Win32::APIRegistry):
        SetForegroundWindow
	GetDesktopWindow 
	GetWindow 
	GetWindowText 
	GetClassName 
	GetParent
	GetWindowLong
	SetFocus

    - Ported FindWindowLike (MS-KB, Article ID: Q147659) from VB to
      Perl. Instead of using VB's "like", I used Perl regexps.
	
0.03  Sun Oct 31 18:31:52 1999

    - Perhaps first version released thru CPAN (user: erngui).

    - Changed name from Win32::Test to Win32::GuiTest

    - Fixed bug: using strdup resulted in using system malloc and 
      perl's free, resulting in a runtime error.  
      This way we always use perl's malloc. Got the idea from
      'ext\Dynaloader\dl_aix.xs:calloc'.

0.04  Fri Jan 7 17:44:00 2000

    - Fixed Compatibility with ActivePerl 522. Thanks to
      Johannes Maehner <johanm@camline.com> for the initial patch.
      There were two main issues: 
        /1/ ActivePerl (without CAPI=TRUE) compiles extensions in C++ mode 
            (some casts from void*, etc.. were needed).
        /2/ The old typemap + buffers.h I was using had been rendered
            incompatible by changes in ActivePerl. As the incompatible typemaps
            were redundant, I deleted them. 
      Now it works on ActivePerl (both using 'perl makefile.pl' 
      and 'perl makefile.pl CAPI=TRUE') and on CPAN perl 
      (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.zip). 

    - As requests for changes keep comming in, I've decided to put it all
      under version control (cvs if you're curious about it).	

0.05 Sat Mar 11 23:11:42 2000

    - Added support for sending function keys (e.g. "%{F4}"). A new test 
      script is added to the distribution (eg\notepad.pl) to test
      this functionality.

    - Code cleanup to make adding new keywords easier.

0.06 Sun Mar 12 01:51:18 2000

    - Added support for sending mouse events.
      Thanks to Ben Shern <shernbj@louisville.stortek.com> for the idea 
      and original code. Also added 'eg\paint.pl' to the distribution to
      test this functionality.

    - Code cleanup.


0.07 Sun Nov 19 13:02:00 2000

    - Added MouseMoveAbsPix to allow moving the mouse to an absolute pixel 
      coordinate instead of using mouse_event's (0, 0) to (65535, 65535) 
      coordinates.
      Thanks to Phill Wolf <pbwolf@bellatlantic.net> for the idea 
      and original code. Also added 'eg\paint_abs.pl' to the distribution 
      to test this functionality.

    - Added binaries for the ActivePerl distribution. 

0.08 Sun Dec 17 19:33:07 2000

    - Added WMGetText to allow getting the content of an EDIT window. See 
      'eg\notepad_text.pl' for more details. 
      Thanks to Mauro <m_servizi@yahoo.it> from Italy for the idea. 

0.09 Thu Jan 4 22:30:50 2001

    - Added {SPC} action to sendkeys to simulate hitting the spacebar.
      Thanks to Sohrab Niramwalla <sohrab.niramwalla@utoronto.ca> for the 
      idea. 

1.00 Sun May 13 22:02:01 2001

    - Fixed a bug in FindWindowLike that caused duplicated window handles to
      be returned.

    - Simplified the logic in FindWindowLike.

    - Added IsChild and GetChildDepth functions. Exported GetChildWindows.

    - Added more tests (tightening the net in XP-speak)

    - Added 'eg\spy--.pl' to the distribution.

1.10 Sun Jun 17 19:54:27 2001

    - Added GetWindowRect, GetScreenRes, ScreenToNorm and NormToScreen,
      following suggestion and code from Frank van Dijk <fvdijk@oke.nl>.

    - Added SendMessage, PostMessage, GetCursorPos, AttachWin,
      additional SendKeys flags (Windows keys and context menu),
      WMSetText, GetCaretPos, GetFocus, GetActiveWindow, GetForegroundWindow,
      SetActiveWindow, EnableWindow, IsWindowEnabled, IsWindowVisible and
      ShowWindow (+ constants to use it).

      Thanks to Jarek Jurasz <jurasz@imb.uni-karlsruhe.de> for all of them.

      Jarek also provided two scripts: 'eg\showmouse.pl' and 'eg\showwin.pl'.
      I found showwin very interesting (if somewhat dangerous!).

      He also fixed an export list problem (WMGetKey was mentioned instead
      of WMGetText) and added export tags :ALL and :SW, so that full module
      functionality can be imported with

                   use Win32::GuiTest qw(:ALL :SW);

    - Added IsWindow, ScreenToClient, ClientToScreen, IsCheckedButton and
      IsGrayedButton.

    - SendKeys now takes an optional parameter to change the default 50 ms
      delay between keystrokes. Suggested by Wilson P. Snyder II
      <wsnyder@world.std.com>.

1.20 Wed Jul 18 20:44:11  2001

    - Added GetComboText, GetComboContents, GetListText and GetListContents
      to allow easy extraction of data from list and combo boxes.

    - Added 'eg\fonts.pl' to show the new functionality. This script opens
      the Notepad "Font" dialog and prints to stdout the contents of the Font
      combobox.

    - Fixed bug in SendMessage (and others), where the return value was lost
      Caused by a missing OUTPUT tag.

    - Added IsKeyPressed function. Suggested by Rudi Farkas.
      See 'eg\keypress.pl' for a demo. Works even if the script
      is running in the background.

    - Fixed bad POD formating. Added podchecker and html pod generation to makedist.bat.

1.40 --- ---  - --:--:-- ----

    Big thanks to an anonymous contributor for the following pieces:

    - Added WaitWindowLike and WaitWindow. See 'eg\WaitWindow.pl' for an example.
      The test.pl code changed as a consequence as I now use WaitWindowLike instead
      of sleep+FindWindowLike. 

    - Added IsWindowStyle and IsWindowStyleEx and 'eg/IsWindowStyle.pl'.

    - Added SelectTabItem and 'eg/selecttabitem.pl'.

    - Added MenuSelect and 'eg/menuselect.pl'.
